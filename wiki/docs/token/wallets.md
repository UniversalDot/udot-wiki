## Polkadot Extension

The most convenient way to start using the application is to install the polkadot.js extension. 
The extension allows you to sign transactions on the UDOT blockchain. 

You can install the extension through your favorite web browser:
- On Chrome, install via [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)
- On Firefox, install via [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)

After the Polkadot extension is installed, create (or import) your account and then you can sign in on the universaldot.me web dapp (decentralized application) by visiting this [link](https://app.universaldot.me). To use the dapp, you will need UDOT tokens.
