# Development

## Front-end development

It is possible to develop your own front-end application that integrates and connects with the application. 

For more details on what data is available in the substrate node, we will refer you to the [API section](../sdk/api.md).

## Rust development

In addition, it is also possible to build on top of the pallets we have already provided under open Apache 2.0 License.

The custom pallets that have been developed can be found our our [Github](https://github.com/UniversalDot/universal-dot-node/tree/universal-develop/pallets) repository.
