The WIKI is split in three sections. 

In the Build Section, you get to **Build** something amazing using UDOT.

Build a digital **organization** and hire remote talent from around the world.

Build a **front-end** application that interacts with Substrate.

Build using the  **API** documentation that we have made available.
