# UniversalDot Foundation
### Mission 

UniversalDot Foundation is focused on creating applications for the decentralized internet. Our mission is to enable freedom for each individual to create their own vision of the future. We believe that such a mission can be enabled through the creation of decentralized applications and infrastructure.
