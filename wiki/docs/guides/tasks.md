# Tasks

### Overview
Users can interact with one another through Tasks.

There are two types of Users who can interact with tasks. We call them Initiators and Volunteers.

* Initiators are people who have the permission to Create and Remove Tasks.
* Volunteers are people who have the permission to Start and Complete Tasks.

Anybody can become an Initiator or Volunteer. In other words, one doesnâ€™t need permission to become an Initiator or Volunteer.

When Tasks are created, there is some associated metadata that shall be defined. This includes the following:

* Task Title
* Task Specification (Defining the Task specification)
* Task Budget (The cost of completion for the Task)
* Task Deadline (The specified time until which the task should be completed)
Furthermore, budget funds are locked in escrow when task is created. Funds are removed from escrow when task is removed.
