# Tasks

### Overview

Users can interact with one another through Tasks.

There are two types of Users who can interact with tasks. We call them Initiators and Volunteers.

* Initiators are people who have the permission to Create Tasks.
* Volunteers are people who have the permission to Complete Tasks.

Anybody can become an Initiator or Volunteer. In other words, one doesnâ€™t need permission to become an Initiator or Volunteer.
