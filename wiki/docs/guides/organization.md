# Organizations

### Overview

The DAO organizes People with a common Vision to work on projects. The DAO works as an extension to the Task module since it enables the creation of large projects which collect many tasks.

A visionary user is able to propose a Vision for the future. Within the vision, a specified Roadmap is created that is broken down into tasks. Thus a DAO is a collection of tasks who are undertaken by people that believe in the vision of the Founder.

Users support a Vision by signing a vision document. Signing a vision document enables users to be added to a DAO where they will be able to create/fulfill tasks in support of the overall vision.

For completion of tasks, users are rewarded tokens and increased reputation.

### How To Create An Organization (DAO)

To create your own DAO navigate to the `Organization` tab in the menu and then click on `Own organization`. Here you will be given several action options which include the following

* Create Vision
* Remove Vision
* Create Organization
* Remove Organization
* Add member
* Remove members
* Add task
* Remove task

Clicking on `Create organization` open a modal dialog where you can fill out organizational details.
