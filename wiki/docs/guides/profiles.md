# Profiles

Profile is essential part of the universaldot.me application. 

 The Profile is used to enrich the AccountID information with user specific metadata such as personal interests, name, reputation, etc. Each User can create a single user profile per AccountID.

By creating a profile, you are broadcasting to the network your self-assigned username and interests. Anyone is allowed to create a identity.

Furthermore, in the future tasks will be recommended to you based on your interests. For example, if you are interested in web-development we will traverse through all the tasks available in the network and suggest some web-development tasks that are suitable for you.

### Profile Reputation

To ensure that every user acts with integrity, the system keeps track of reputation. Reputation is rewarded each time user contributes to a task, organization. Reputation is taken away when the user negatively contributes to previously established contracts. 

The following formula is used to calculate profile reputation when interacting with tasks.


![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Reputation(s_{j})&space;=&space;\frac{\sum_{x=1}^{L}&space;(PersEval_{j}^{x})&space;*&space;C_{r}(x)}{\sum_{x=1}^{L}&space;C_{r}(x)})

where 
Reputation(sj) - the assessed reputation of sj as calculated by the service consumer and Cr(x) is the credibility of the service rater x as viewed by the service consumer. 

The credibility of a service rater lies in the interval [0,1] with 0 identifying a dishonest rater and 1 an honest one.
